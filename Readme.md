# React Job Application

## About the Application
This is a simple React application that fetches job data from a JSON file and displays it to the user. The user can filter the jobs by tags and undo the filtering by clicking the cancel icon next to each clicked tag. Additionally, there is a clear button that removes all filters and displays all jobs.

To achieve this functionality, the following tools were used:

Tags: `javascript`, `react`, `redux`

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- HTML: The markup language used to structure the application.
- CSS: The stylesheets used for the application's visual presentation.
